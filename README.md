# A/B Test: Comparing Bidding Methods' Conversion

## 1. Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding method called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" method. One of our clients, **bombabomba.com**, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to determine if average bidding brings in more conversions compared to maximum bidding.

The A/B test has been running for 1 month, and **bombabomba.com** is now looking for an analysis of the test results. The key metric of success for **bombabomba.com** is "Purchase," which means that the focus of the statistical testing should be on this metric.

### Task:
Analyze the results of the A/B test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the "Purchase" metric between the "maximum bidding" and "average bidding" methods.

## 2. Dataset Story

The dataset provides information about a company's website performance, including the number of ad impressions, clicks on ads, and revenue generated from these ads. There are two separate datasets: one for the control group, which used the **maximum bidding** method, and another for the test group, which used the **average bidding** method. Both datasets are contained in an Excel file on separate sheets.

### 2.1 Variables:
- **Impression**: Number of ad impressions
- **Click**: Number of clicks on ads
- **Purchase**: Number of products purchased after clicking on ads
- **Earning**: Revenue generated from the purchased products

## 3. Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to determine whether the **average bidding** method introduced by Facebook results in more conversions (purchases) compared to the existing **maximum bidding** method. Through this A/B test, we will perform statistical testing to verify if there is a significant difference between the two methods.

### Key Goals:
1. Conduct an A/B test analysis on the **Purchase** metric to evaluate the performance of the bidding methods.
2. Assess if the new bidding method (average bidding) outperforms the existing one (maximum bidding) in terms of driving more conversions.

## 4. Conclusion

This analysis will provide **bombabomba.com** with data-driven insights regarding the effectiveness of the new **average bidding** method. Based on the statistical testing results, recommendations will be provided on whether to adopt the average bidding method for future campaigns. This will ultimately help optimize ad spend and improve conversion rates.
